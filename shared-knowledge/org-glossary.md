# InCharge Org Glossary (shared knowledge)

Seed version, pulled from the Accounting knowledge base on 2026-09-28.
Updated 2026-10-01 with department names and abbreviations from the
InCharge Departments and Key People directory (roster dated 2026-07-20); full directory table added below.
Anyone using a skill that touches process mapping should treat this as a
starting point, not a verified directory — confirm names/roles before
publishing anything outward-facing.

## Lines of business

Four revenue-producing lines of business (LOB). The four-LOB structure and the
"Turn Chargers On / Keep Chargers On" mapping are a working framing for
finance and reporting, not an approved taxonomy; confirm with Finance.

- **Service** — Reactive and planned field-service work delivered against a
  Work Order.
  - Tracked in Salesforce/ServiceMax (SVMX); dispatch driven; technician
    labor and parts usage.
  - Time & Materials or contract billable. Billed once a Work Order reaches
    the Ready-to-Invoice milestone. Responsibility Center = SERVICE.
  - Examples: charger repair, warranty repair, PM inspections, cable
    replacements, troubleshooting visits.
- **EPC** (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) — Project-based delivery
  of charging infrastructure.
  - Identified by project number, which carries a state-code suffix (e.g.
    `395876CA`). Managed in Procore; also tracked in Excel/Smartsheet and
    Business Central (BC).
  - Construction activities, progress billing, change orders, revenue
    recognition by project.
  - Examples: new depot construction, fleet charging installation, utility
    upgrades, site commissioning.
- **Software** — Sale of software products and software renewals.
  - InControl is the standalone software offering in the internal product
    catalog. Software licenses and renewals.
  - Typically invoiced 100% upfront at contract start; moving to
    PayFabric-based payment collection (payment links from Salesforce quotes).
  - Examples: InControl subscriptions, annual renewals, expansion licenses.
- **Recurring Services** (Managed & Recurring Services) — Ongoing
  contractual services that produce recurring revenue independent of
  individual Work Orders.
  - Examples: LASO, DASSO, subscription support programs, managed charging
    services, partnerships such as Voltpost.
  - The area creating the most process strain: it fits neither Service Work
    Orders nor EPC projects, and current tooling doesn't yet support it well.

**Enabling functions** (not revenue-producing LOBs): Sales, Product
Development, Finance, Warehouse / Fulfillment, Asset Management, NOC,
Technical Support, HR, IT.

**Executive summary.** InCharge is in the business of "Turn Chargers On" and
"Keep Chargers On" (SKO deck):

| Theme | LOBs |
| --- | --- |
| Turn Chargers On | EPC + Software |
| Keep Chargers On | Service + Recurring Services |

EPC and Software get chargers deployed and operational; Service and
Recurring Services keep them operating over time.
